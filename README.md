## Hey, I'm Samyak

I write backend code that (mostly) doesn't crash at 3 AM. Currently building cloud testing infrastructure at scale — because someone has to make sure *your* code works too.

Started out training neural networks to predict stock prices. The models were right 50% of the time, which is technically better than my gut feeling. Now I build distributed systems where "it works on my machine" is never an acceptable answer.

### Things I break (and then fix)

**Daily drivers:** Go, Node.js, Python, Kafka, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure, Redis, PostgreSQL

**When I feel nostalgic:** TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM, NLP, Scikit-learn, Pandas

### Projects worth checking out

- **[Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM](https://github.com/samyakgoyal/Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM)** — Teaching machines to lose money in the stock market, scientifically
- **[Music-generator](https://github.com/samyakgoyal/Music-generator)** — AI-generated music that's somehow both impressive and unsettling
